# Modern PHP Course

## A hands-on project-based PHP course for beginner to intermediate

In this course you will start building a real world, functional social media platform, ready to customize and share, starting from lesson 1 and incrementally building up knowledge at the same time as building the project step by step.

But the real twist comes in section 2 of the book where we will build the same project again, but this time taking the kiddy wheels off. Instead of subordinating the progress to the didactics, we will build the app again from scratch attempting to follow, as closely as possible, a real-world workflow; not from the perspective of a tutorial, slowly learning about variables, functions, syntax, etc., but from the perspective of how a real fullstack developer would write this app. This way we will bridge the gap between learner and developer and escape tutorial hell once and for all. 

## How to use

The course is basically an e-book in the form of `.md` files, simply clone the repo, or download file by file and open in a markdown editor to get syntax highlighting --or even read directly in the repo page-- and follow along. You will find the lesson files in the `Lessons/` directory and course information, including app speciffication, table of contents and course style guidelines in the `Docs/` directory.

## Caveat

This is a learning project. I'm developing this course with the help of Claude.ai; this is me learning PHP as well, so I guess well see if the course and my method for developing it work. The main function of files in the `Docs/` directory is to be able to feed them repeatedly to the AI to have consistency throughout the development of course. 

You are welcome to clone it, fork it, use those files and modify them to create sommething your own. As for pull requests, I don't think I'll take many but iff you see a blatant error in the code please let me know.

I will upload new lessons as I generate them and go through them, I'm a slow learner so be patient.
