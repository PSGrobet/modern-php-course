## Lesson Format Standards

### Every Lesson Must Include:

#### 1. Header Section

```markdown
# Chapter X, Lesson X.X: [Descriptive Title]
**Goal:** [One clear sentence describing what students will achieve]
**Time:** [Estimated duration: 1-2 hours]
**Prerequisites:** [What they need to know first]
```

#### 2. Learning Section (20-30 minutes)

- **Concept Overview:** Why this matters for the project
- **Key Points:** 3-5 main concepts with examples
- **Real-world Context:** How this applies to social platforms
- **Code Examples:** Short, focused snippets

#### 3. Practice Section (60-90 minutes)

- **Step-by-step Instructions:** Clear, numbered steps
- **Complete Code Files:** Full, working examples
- **Testing Guidelines:** How to verify it works
- **Common Issues:** What might go wrong and fixes

#### 4. Wrap-up Section

- **Key Takeaways:** 3-5 bullet points of what was learned
- **Project Progress:** What was built in this lesson
- **Next Preview:** What's coming in the next lesson

---

## Code Consistency Rules

### File Naming Conventions

- **Lesson files:** `chapter-X-lesson-X.php`
- **Project files:** Use descriptive names (`user-profile.php`, `post-feed.php`)
- **Database files:** `database-setup.sql`, `sample-data.sql`

### Code Style Standards

```php
<?php
// Always include file header comment
/**
 * Social Platform Project - Chapter X, Lesson X
 * [Brief description of file purpose]
 */

// Use meaningful variable names
$user_posts = [];          // Good
$data = [];               // Bad

// Consistent indentation (4 spaces)
if ($user_is_logged_in) {
    echo "Welcome back!";
}

// Always include error handling
try {
    $db = new PDO($dsn, $username, $password);
} catch (PDOException $e) {
    die("Connection failed: " . $e->getMessage());
}
?>
```

### HTML/CSS Standards

```html
<!-- Use semantic HTML -->
<article class="post">
    <header class="post-header">
        <h2 class="post-title">Title</h2>
    </header>
    <main class="post-content">
        Content here
    </main>
</article>

<!-- Consistent CSS class naming -->
.post-card { }           <!-- Good -->
.postCard { }            <!-- Bad -->
.pc { }                  <!-- Bad -->
```

## Project Consistency Rules

### Database Schema Consistency

```sql
-- Consistent table naming (plural, lowercase)
CREATE TABLE users (
    id INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
    username VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL UNIQUE,
    email VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL UNIQUE,
    created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
);

-- Consistent field naming
user_id (not userId or user)
created_at (not createdAt or date_created)
```

### Feature Implementation Consistency

#### Section 1 Approach:

- **Explanation first:** "Here's what we're building and why"
- **Step-by-step:** Every line of code explained
- **Safety first:** Basic security from the start
- **Learning focus:** Understanding over efficiency

#### Section 2 Approach:

- **Goal-oriented:** "We need to implement X feature"
- **Professional structure:** Proper MVC, separation of concerns
- **Best practices:** Industry-standard approaches
- **Efficiency focus:** Clean, maintainable code

## Quality Checkpoints

### Before Each Lesson Release:

- [ ] Code tested on fresh LAMP stack
- [ ] All files created and accessible
- [ ] Screenshots/examples match current code
- [ ] Next lesson prerequisites are clear
- [ ] Estimated time is realistic

### Every 5 Lessons (Chapter Complete):

- [ ] Chapter project works end-to-end
- [ ] All previous functionality still works
- [ ] Code style is consistent
- [ ] Learning objectives met

### Section Complete Reviews:

- [ ] Complete project functions as intended
- [ ] Code quality review
- [ ] Security review
- [ ] Performance review
- [ ] Documentation complete

---

## Student Experience Guidelines

### Learning Progression

1. **Success Early:** First lesson should feel rewarding
2. **Gradual Complexity:** Each lesson adds one main concept
3. **Immediate Feedback:** Students see results quickly
4. **Error Recovery:** Clear guidance when things go wrong
5. **Confidence Building:** Regular "you did it!" moments

### Common Student Pain Points to Address

- **Environment Issues:** Clear setup instructions
- **Code Not Working:** Troubleshooting sections
- **Falling Behind:** Flexible pacing guidance
- **Overwhelming Concepts:** Break into smaller pieces
- **Lost Context:** Regular "where we are" reminders

## Content Review Checklist

### Technical Accuracy

- [ ] Code runs without errors
- [ ] Security practices are current
- [ ] Database queries are optimized
- [ ] Cross-platform compatibility verified

### Educational Quality

- [ ] Learning objectives are clear and met
- [ ] Examples are relevant and engaging
- [ ] Difficulty progression is appropriate
- [ ] Practical application is obvious

### Consistency Check

- [ ] Terminology is consistent throughout
- [ ] Code style follows established guidelines
- [ ] Project structure maintains integrity
- [ ] References to previous lessons are accurate

---

## Communication & Feedback

### When to Pause and Review:

- After completing each chapter
- When introducing major new concepts
- If complexity seems to jump too quickly
- When student feedback indicates issues

### Consistency Reminders to Use:

- "Remember from Chapter X..."
- "This builds on what we learned about..."
- "You can find this in your `filename.php` from Lesson X.X"
- "This follows the same pattern as..."

---

## Version Control for Course Development

### Commit Message Format:

- `Chapter X.X: [Lesson Title] - Initial draft`
- `Chapter X.X: Code review and fixes`
- `Chapter X: Complete and tested`

### Branch Strategy:

- `main`: Completed, reviewed content
- `chapter-X`: Development of specific chapters
- `review`: Content under review

---

## Success Metrics

### Student Success Indicators:

- Code works on first try (high-quality instructions)
- Questions focus on "how to extend" rather than "why doesn't this work"
- Students share their customized versions
- Completion rate remains high through difficult sections

### Course Quality Indicators:

- Consistent time estimates (±30 minutes)
- Low error/correction rate
- Positive progression feedback
- Technical accuracy maintained

This framework will keep us on track for creating a truly professional, consistent course that genuinely teaches modern PHP development while building something impressive!
