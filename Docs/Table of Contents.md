## Course Philosophy

This course assumes you understand programming basics but are new to PHP. We focus on:

- **PHP-specific syntax and patterns**
- **Building real, working features**
- **Practical application over theory**
- **Modern PHP practices from day one**
- **Code that you can actually deploy and use**

The goal is to bridge the gap between tutorial projects and real-world applications by building something you'd actually want to use and customize.
